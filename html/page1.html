    <h1>What is Outsourcing?</h1>
    <p>
        Outsourcing is the practice of hiring an outside company or individual(s) to perform services 
        or manufacture products, often to free up in-house employees for higher-level tasks or to cut 
        equipment overhead costs. This can cut costs and serve as a strategic management tool for 
        businesses. 
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h1>Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
    <ul>
        <li class="pro">
            <p>
                Outsourcing can help companies benefit from the differences in labor and
                production costs in other countries, allowing the business to increase profits while staying
                competitive in the industry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="pro">
            <p>
                When one outsources, one has access to a much larger variety of employees with
                different skills. If one needs specialized labor, outsourcing is a great option.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="pro">
            <p>
                Hiring people around the world in different timezones means that, with coordination,
                one can create a 24-hour production cycle. This means that production, IT, customer support, etc. 
                can keep running at all times.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li class="con">
            <p>
                Writing and signing contracts with outside companies may take time and effort for a 
                firm's legal team and must be thorough in order to prevent possible legal liabilities.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="con">
            <p>
                One must be cautious to avoid data breaches due to outside parties having access to one's
                company's private data.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="con">
            <p>
                Outsourcing has some ethical criticisms: contract workers, especially in other countries,
                might earn less money and fewer benefits, creating workforce inequality.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li class="con">
            <p>
                Communication with people in other countries and timezones can be difficult.
            </p>
