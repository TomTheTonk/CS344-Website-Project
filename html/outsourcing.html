        <h3>What is Outsourcing?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
        Outsourcing is the practice of hiring an outside company or individual(s) to perform services 
        or manufacture products, often to free up in-house employees for higher-level tasks or to cut 
        equipment overhead costs. This can cut costs and serve as a strategic management tool for 
        businesses.

        <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>

            <li class="pro">
                <p>
                    Outsourcing can help companies benefit from the differences in labor and
                    production costs in other countries, allowing the business to increase profits while staying
                    competitive in the industry.

            <li class="pro">
                <p>
                    When one outsources, one has access to a much larger variety of employees with
                    different skills. If one needs specialized labor, outsourcing is a great option.

                <p>
                    Hiring people around the world in different timezones means that, with coordination,
                    one can create a 24-hour production cycle. This means that production, IT, customer support, etc. 
                    can keep running at all times.

                    Writing and signing contracts with outside companies may take time and effort for a 
                    firm's legal team and must be thorough in order to prevent possible legal liabilities.

                <p>
                    One must be cautious to avoid data breaches due to outside parties having access to one's
                    company's private data.

                    Outsourcing has some ethical criticisms: contract workers, especially in other countries,
                    might earn less money and fewer benefits, creating workforce inequality.
